🌿Project Idea: “Predicting Student Performance”

🎯 Goal

1. Build models that can:

2. Predict exam scores (regression)

3. Classify students as “pass/fail” (classification)

4. Group students into learning clusters (clustering)

You’ll get to explore bias vs. variance, parametric vs. non-parametric models, and model flexibility,  all in one project.
