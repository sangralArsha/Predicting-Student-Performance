Project Idea: “Predicting Student Performance”

🎯 Goal

Build models that can:

Predict exam scores (regression)

Classify students as “pass/fail” (classification)

Group students into learning clusters (clustering)

You’ll get to explore bias vs. variance, parametric vs. non-parametric models, and model flexibility,  all in one project.
